GO-ON is a web-based platform that uses real-time and historic data to offer its users the fastest way to travel around Lisbon.
With gathered on-board data, with the help of UPLY, it is possible to inform the users of the transport's current capacity, and exactly how much time it takes to reach your stop.


The database is run in MySQL, where the data from the UPLYs is stored and then relayed to the users through the app. This can be accessed in go-onlisboa.pt.
